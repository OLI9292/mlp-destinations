Aside from the individual country differences the safari options are also abundant, and it is essential to have a knowledgeable and trustworthy resource. The specialists I work with have often lived and worked in their regions of expertise and each have a deep love of Africa which translates to the service they provide. Whether it is a self-drive safari in Namibia, a tour of the souks in Fez or a gorilla trek you will be connected to a true expert.',

This all comes down to knowing the right people on the ground and the loyalty that can only be achieved by their long-term working relationships with the specialist. Traveling to Asia is not only about visiting cultural sites but receiving the right advice to pace your time and not overload your itinerary. For example, India is such a huge and diverse country that it is advisable to savor fewer areas for longer rather than rush around with only a day or two in each place.',

It is also a region where two countries often combine well, such as Peru with Bolivia and Argentina and Uruguay. And now there are an exciting number of independent, design-worthy lodges in the more extreme and stunningly beautiful areas so you donâ€™t have to rough it.
